# Antonia.Polygon-1.2-MeshOnly
A human mesh in OBJ format.

This repository contains the lo- and hi-res meshes for Antonia Polygon Version 1.2 with my original UV mapping (a.k.a. mapping A). These meshes are now copyright-free (see license). Note that the new licensing only affects the two files in this repository, `AntoniaA-1.2.obj` and `AntoniaA-lo-1.2.obj`, and nothing else.
